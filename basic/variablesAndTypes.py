# Python is completely object-oriented but not "staticaly typed". All variables in python are object.
myInt = 7
# myInt is a variable. In python, it's an object
# print(myInt)

# if i want to define a floating number:

myFloat = 7.0
# or
myFloat2 = float(7.0)
# print(myFloat)
# print(myFloat2)

# mixing operators between numbers and strings are not supported!
num = 1
word = "one"

print(num + word)
